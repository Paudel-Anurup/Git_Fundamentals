# Hi, I am new to github and this is my first test file initialized in a local repository.
*As I progress through my journey I will be adding a cheatsheet of operating git from command line that I can reference in the future*

# created a new branch named "Test"

# will this line get pushed to the test branch in my  repo?? yes it was succesfull
